Installation
============

Currently the easiest way to install Flask-Websockets is from source, e.g., using GitHub:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e git+https://github.com/shoeffner/Flask-Websockets.git@master#egg=Flask-Websockets

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it from there:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/shoeffner/Flask-Websockets.git
   cd Flask-Websockets
   pip install -e .

As I do not know yet if I can maintain this project beyond that, I did not put it up on PyPI.
